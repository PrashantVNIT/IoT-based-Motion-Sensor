### 1.	Project at a glance…

This project is based on IoT(Internet of Things).We have made an intruder alarm using ESP8266 microcontroller, PIR Motion sensor and Buzzer (as important components) etc.

When anybody (human, animal or body emitting infrared radiations) emitting heat waves comes close to our project (installation site). PIR motion sensor will instantly detect the presence of it and rings a buzzer alarm to notify us about an intrusion. The microcontroller sends a notification on the phone through IFTTT Webhooks (which helps us connect all of our different apps and devices) and also sounds the buzzer when motion is detected.
